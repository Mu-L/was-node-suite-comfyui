# three-gpu-pathtracer, vendored

GPU path tracer and BVH builder used by the Three Path Trace Render node.

- Upstream: <https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer>
- Version 0.0.24, npm `three-gpu-pathtracer@0.0.24`
- Licence: MIT, retained verbatim in `LICENSE.pathtracer` beside this file

## three-mesh-bvh, its dependency

The path tracer traces against a bounding volume hierarchy built by a separate package, taken
with it.

- Upstream: <https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh>
- Version 0.9.14, npm `three-mesh-bvh@0.9.14`
- Licence: MIT, retained verbatim in `LICENSE.mesh-bvh` beside this file

## Files taken from upstream

| File | Upstream path | Changed |
|---|---|---|
| `index.module.js` | `three-gpu-pathtracer@0.0.24/build/index.module.js` | import specifiers |
| `mesh-bvh.js` | `three-mesh-bvh@0.9.14/build/index.module.js` | import specifiers |

Both are the published single-file builds. Each imports the bare specifiers `three`,
`three-mesh-bvh` and `three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/Pass.js`, and each of those is
rewritten to the relative path of the copy in `web/vendor/`. Nothing else in either file is
altered. Nothing is fetched over the network at runtime.

`xatlas-web` is listed upstream as a peer dependency. Neither build imports it, and the
lightmap baker that uses it is not taken, so it is not present.

## Not taken

The upstream `src/` tree, its examples and its test fixtures are not taken. The two builds
above carry everything the node loads, and both are loaded on demand rather than with the
rest of the pack.
