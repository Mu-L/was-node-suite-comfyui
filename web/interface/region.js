/**
 * Build the region editor for one node.
 *
 * @param {object} options - How the editor reads, writes and draws.
 * @param {object} [options.node] - The node the editor is drawn on. Used to repaint the graph
 *   after a write, and for nothing else.
 * @param {{load: () => Promise<object>}} options.backdrop - What is drawn behind the
 *   rectangle, from `imageBackdrop`, `blankBackdrop` or anything answering the same shape.
 * @param {{read: () => object, write: (rect: object, moved: object) => void,
 *   locks?: () => object}} options.rect - The accessor pair.
 *
 *   `read` answers the rectangle the node's widgets hold, as `{x, y, w, h}` in frame units,
 *   exactly as they are held. A number outside the frame is answered as it stands.
 *
 *   `write` is called once per gesture with the whole rectangle, including the edges the
 *   gesture left alone, and a map holding `true` for each edge that ended somewhere else. The
 *   rectangle is whole, which gives a node holding an origin and a size both edges of an axis;
 *   the map is what says which of its widgets the gesture was
 *   actually about, so a drag on one edge leaves the rest of them alone. A widget already
 *   holding the value it would be given is left unassigned, as every widget write in this pack
 *   is.
 *
 *   `locks` answers a map from edge to the name of the input that stops it moving, holding
 *   only the edges that cannot move. An edge is locked when any widget the edge would write is
 *   filled in by a link, since a link is what the run reads instead of the widget. It is asked
 *   with the gesture's own kind, one of `GESTURE`: the widgets a translation writes are
 *   not always the widgets a resize writes.
 * @param {(rect: object, moved: object) => object} [options.coerce] - The rectangle the adopter
 *   would actually write for the one a gesture reached, answered as `{x, y, w, h}` in frame
 *   units. A node holding a shape its four numbers cannot spell, a square for one, states it
 *   here: the answer is what is drawn, what the readout quotes and what `write` is given, so the
 *   rubber band, the footer and the value stored are one rectangle rather than three. Left out,
 *   a gesture is held exactly as it was made.
 * @param {string|((rect: object) => string)} [options.footer] - What the rectangle means, in the
 *   adopter's own words, drawn on the second footer line whatever else is on screen. Called with
 *   the rectangle on screen, which is the one an unfinished gesture holds while there is one, so
 *   the line describes what the numbers above it say rather than what the widgets still hold. It
 *   carries values and states: what the node will write, what it will hand on, and anything that
 *   changes what somebody should do next.
 * @param {string|((rect: object) => string)} [options.hover] - What those numbers are measured in
 *   and what the node does with them, in the adopter's own words, put on the footer's own hover
 *   text rather than drawn. A unit and a rule do not change as somebody works, so they are
 *   reachable from the numbers they are about instead of standing beside them every frame.
 * @param {number} [options.height] - Height of the appended widget in node units.
 * @param {number} [options.step] - What one arrow press moves the rectangle by.
 * @param {number|(() => number)} [options.coarseStep] - What an arrow press with shift moves it
 *   by, and the grid a gesture with shift snaps to. A function is asked at each gesture, which is
 *   what a node carrying its own step as a widget states.
 * @param {number} [options.gridStep] - The grid every gesture lands on, for a node whose numbers
 *   carry a step of their own. Applied while the gesture is dragged rather than as it is
 *   written, so the rectangle drawn, the readout and the smallest size all agree with the value
 *   stored. The frame's own edge and the smallest size are held to after it, so an edge stopped
 *   by either lands where it was stopped, and alt holds a corner to its aspect instead, since
 *   one corner cannot honour both. Left out, a gesture lands wherever it was made.
 * @param {number} [options.minSize] - The smallest width or height a gesture can produce.
 * @param {boolean} [options.integer] - Whether written values are whole frame units. True by
 *   default, since a node's rectangle is usually declared as integers.
 * @param {Array<(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, view: object, theme: object) => Array<object>|void>}
 *   [options.layers] - What else is drawn over the frame, in order, between the backdrop and
 *   the rectangle. Each is handed the context, the view a position converts through, and the
 *   theme, and may answer hover regions in element pixels, `{x, y, width, height, title}`,
 *   which are offered to the pointer ahead of the footer's own. A layer that throws is logged
 *   and skipped, and the rest of the frame is still drawn.
 * @param {{cursor?: (context: object) => string,
 *   pointerDown?: (event: PointerEvent, context: object) => boolean,
 *   pointerMove?: (event: PointerEvent, context: object) => boolean,
 *   pointerUp?: (event: PointerEvent, context: object) => boolean,
 *   cancel?: () => void, leave?: () => void}} [options.tool] - A tool that gets first refusal on
 *   the pointer, from `mask_paint.js` or anything answering the same shape. Each pointer member
 *   answers true when the tool took the event, which stops the rectangle from seeing it, and the
 *   editor holds the pointer capture for a gesture the tool claimed. `cursor` answers what the
 *   pointer looks like, or an empty string to leave that to the rectangle. `cancel` ends a
 *   claimed gesture that lost its capture or its window, which arrives with no pointerup, and
 *   `leave` says the pointer is no longer over the element. The context carries `point` in
 *   element pixels, `frame`, the same position in frame units or null while there is no frame,
 *   `view` and `modifiers`.
 * @returns {{element: HTMLElement, height: number, schedulePaint: () => void,
 *   handleRectChanged: () => void, refresh: () => void, dispose: () => void}} The element to
 *   hand to `addDOMWidget`, the height it was built for, a coalesced repaint, the repaint to
 *   run when a widget changed, a fresh ask for the backdrop, and teardown.
