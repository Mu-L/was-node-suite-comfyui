    """Write every frame of a video to ``output_folder`` as a numbered image.

    Args:
        video_file: Video to read. Any container and codec libavformat can demux.
        output_folder: Directory to write into. Created if it does not exist. Existing
            files with the same names are overwritten.
        prefix: Text before the frame number, such as ``"frame_"``. It names a file inside
            ``output_folder``, so it may name a sub-directory but not a drive, a root or a
            ``..`` segment.
        extension: File extension, which decides the image format: ``png``, ``jpg``,
            ``gif`` or ``tiff``.
        zero_padding_digits: Width the frame number is zero-padded to. Zero or less
            numbers the frames without padding, so they sort by name in the wrong order
            past frame 9.

    Returns:
        The number of frames written, counting from the first frame as 0.

        DependencyError: av is not installed.
        FileNotFoundError: ``video_file`` does not exist.
        IndexError: The file holds no video stream.
        PathNotAllowed: ``output_folder`` is outside every permitted write root, or
            ``prefix`` names a file outside it.
